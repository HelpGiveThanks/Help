move time chunk to a different timer
1 17 Timer window
If you want to move any of a timer's chunks of time to another time, you will need to move both its start and stop times.
2 1 Timer window
To reveal start and stop times, click on the edit button.
3 19 Timer Edit window
Start and stop times are revealed.
4 19b Timer Edit window
Click and hold in the stop time box to select all information (date and time).
5 19c Timer Edit window
Drag the stop time to another timer's time chunk box.
6 19b Timer Edit window
Next while stop time is still highlighted in its old location, delete it from there.
7 19b Timer Edit window
Dragging makes a copy, rather than moving a time from the old to the new timer. So, you will need to delete copied time chunks from their old slots, after you have copied them to new locations.
8 19a Timer Edit window
Repeat this dragging process to move the start time, which in this example has already been moved, and finally delete the unwanted start time, which in this example is highlighted.
