Timer 
3 columns of help for graphic to right
1. Opens edit time window.
2. Opens window showing bar-graphs 7b of time chunks instead of amounts of 17 time.
3. Goes to specific action windows.  Highlighted green when TQM actions, or the exercise timers are active and selected.
4. Goes to current library window or if a library is not open, opens last library closed.  Highlighted green when active and selected.
5. Opens a window that allows you to open any of your libraries or the Fat and Muscle Efficiency Research or Budget Research solutions.
6. Back to dashboard window.
7. Opens scale pulldown list you can use to change the length of time over which the bar chart 7b is spread: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 16 hours.
a. Time divisions for bar chart 7b .
b. Bar chart for the selected general action timer.  (The one with the blue square 18 next to it).  The thin black bars, top to bottom, represent chunks of time 17, left to right. The gray bars between them represent the length time  between actions.  In the example above there are 2 gray bars each of which is less than 45 minutes long, meaning that between the 1:25 action and the 0:45 minute action there was a pause of about 20 minutes as that gray bar is not even half way to the 45 minute mark 7a .
8. Name of current user.
9. Left pointing arrows go back one day.  Right arrow button goes forward one day.  Clicking on the date itself opens a drop-down calendar for selected a month/day/year to go to.
10. Minus shrinks while the plus button enlarges the size of everything in the window. 
11. General action timers. Click on any timer to turn it on and off.  Timers have a light background 11a when off and a dark background when active 11b.  The variation in the light background 11a is to visually group timers together.  You can do this by assigning odd or even order numbers to your timers by clicking the edit button  1  and then in the edit window by clicking the edit button next to 11 .  The app gives odd numbered timers the lightest background:   11a    .
12. The 1, 7, and 31 day buttons take you to three different views of your time showing you 1 day of time (current view), 7 days, or 31 days of time.
13. Clears all time for the day for the selected timer (blue square        18 ), but asks you first if you really want to do that with a dialogue box and orange highlight of time, or medium dark gray highlight with dark gray text if you have difficulty seeing colors.
14. Last time used in days.  In example, the exercise brain sample has not be used in 3 days.  Click on this number to be taken back to the day the timer was used or -3 days ago.  Click on a negative number like -3 to be brought forward to the current day.  The new day   14a   timer's larger number is set by going back to the day you were born, clicking the new day timer on and off and then go to the present day to see how may days old you are!  The passage of our lives through time is something to be honest about as each day is precious. By honoring each day we can learn to feel comfortable noting both how we spend each day's time and over many days how the quality of our lives improves in very small ways noted in the specific action log.  For example, I have learned thru this practice that two minutes of cleaning for two people's dishes is enough to do the dishes in a well organized kitchen with a dishwasher.  Now doing the dishes is never a psychological problem because two minutes of my life is not a great sacrifice to have a clean kitchen.
15. Total time for day.
16. Time that a timer was first started.  Plain text = am, italics = pm, and underline = at least a day later, which in this example would be 7/24 or later.
17. Chunks of total time that a timer was active.
18. Square indicating selected timer.  Click in this space to the left of any timer to select it.  The timer will not activate, but any actions like clear time 13 will be performed on this selected timer.  If you click  3  you will be shown the specific actions for the selected timer (which may not be the active timer).
