24.   a    Highlights selected tag light-green (luminosity 73%),

25. Opens this help window.
26. Test group name.  Click to edit.
27. Test group order number.  Leave blank to have test groups  sort in alpha order.
28. Test name.  Click to edit.  Active test has a dark green background (luminosity 10%).

In the example to the right, the air conditioner test list 31c1 has been selected for the heat pump 31b   test as its test-item list 31a3    .  The name "air conditioner" is yellow 31a3 (luminosity 63%) when the heat pump 31b test is selected to indicate that the air conditioner test-item list 31c2 does not belong to the selected test 31b.  A test name is green (luminosity 56%) 31a2 in the tag menus window when the test list 31c1 belongs to the selected test 31a1.
32. The link group feature lets you assign/link a group of test items belonging to one test to another test.  The pulldown menu of test-item groups shows all linkable test-item groups.
In the example to the right, the knowledge 32a test-item group is selected and then added 32a to the bounce & count test.  To remove it 32b, you would need to select the knowledge test 32a group from the list again.
33. Item menu button selects the test-item list menu shown right, which is a list of all test items, or test questions, or checklist items, etc.  It is the list of things that you need to remember to test or check.  In the example to the right, the bounce and count test-item list is a list of actions that a person must do in order to pass this test.  The extractor fan systems' test (to the right) is an inspection checklist of things to note when inspecting extractor fan units.
34. Opens test section tag menu.  See 45 below.
35. Selects main test setup window.  See 16 top.

43. Test-item name.  Click to edit.  Active test has a dark green background (luminosity 10%).
44. Test-item order number.  Leave blank to have test-items sort in alpha order.
45. Creates a new test section.  A test section is another way of grouping tests when it is useful to do so.  Example: you use the test module to create a checklist for things to test/check before a process begins like checking an aircraft before flight (section tag for pre-flight tests), during some point in the process like before landing an plane  (section tag for pre-landing tests), and at the end of the process like after landing the plane  (section tag for post-flight tests).  Example: a home inspection test/checklist with section tags for sections of the house where various test items like insulation, fans, lights, etc. might be found and so require inspection.  
The purpose of the test section tags is to limit the tests that you see to just what is required to be tested at a particular time, place, point in process, etc.  In many cases, like in the case of the exercise tests, which is a progressive test where each tests is harder than the next, it is useful to see all the tests at once, so only one test set is needed   47.
Test section tags control which tests will show up when you click the test button 13 above left in the testing window 58 above right.
46. Deletes a test section not in use after insuring that you really want to delete it with a red highlight and dialogue box: see  4a above left.  
Test sections in use cannot be deleted.
47. Test section name.  Click to edit.
48. Applies selected test-section tag to the selected test 28 above.
You can apply more than one test-section tag to each test as indicated by the light green highlight (luminosity 38%).
