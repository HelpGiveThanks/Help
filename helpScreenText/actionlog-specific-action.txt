a3. All day records associated with a specific action record have light blue or medium gray (luminosity 25%) backgrounds.  
The selected specific action record may be associated with more than one day record, and so more than one day record may show a light blue background to indicate this one to many -- or one specific action record to many day records --relationship. This relationship represents days on which the selected specific action was performed. In the example, two days a3 and a4 are shown on which the selected specific action a2 was performed.

b2. The bar indicating the currently selected day record is dark blue (luminosity 10%).

Every specific action record associated with the currently selected day record has a dark blue background to indicate this one-to-many -- or one day record to many specific action records -- relationship.
