7. Primary node's picture. Click on the box to see a larger version of the picture in a new window.
8. The names of other nodes to apply to all new learn notes as contributers, which you would need if you are making notes during a meeting, like a family meeting to come up with some  rules where each rule is new learn note and all family members are tagged as contributers via the other node and primary node tags.  
To add names to the other-node default list, select names from the Tag Menus' node list.  Click on the O (for other) button next to a name.  
Most of the time, learn notes are personal ideas, so typically the OtherNodes list will be blank.
9. The copyright selected will be applied to all new learn records.  Select copyright from the Tag Menus' copyright list.
10. Test subject's name that will be applied to all tests performed. Select names from the Tag Menus' node list. Tests of building efficiency would be performed on 319 H Street, for example.  If no test subjects are being tested, then no name will be selected.

16. I removed information from 14 and put it in the more information pop-up window 15 eliminating item 16 on this screen.  For now, instead of renumbering all the items on this screen I am just including this note to explain why there is no number  16.  Sorry for any confusion.
